== Singularity image recipes in this repository

Singularity.sherpa-*:: Recipes for images that run the respective Sherpa
version. We use Asterix-themed name tags for recipes that serve a specific
Sherpa git commit. This has no meaning in any other context and just serves as
a mnemonic here, when a user has pulled several such images.
Running a Sherpa image calls `Sherpa`.

Singularity.plotting:: A recipe for an image that includes `Compare-1.9` and
support for `rivet-mkhtml`. This can be used for plotting Sherpa/Rivet analysis
output. Running it calls `rivet-mkhtml`.

Singularity.mceg:: A recipe for an image that serves as the base image for all
`Singularity.sherpa-*` recipes. This allows for a quick build of new Sherpa
images, because the dependencies do not need to be re-compiled.

Singularity.rivet:: A recipe for an image that serves as the base image for all
other recipes in this repository (since they all need Rivet as a dependency).
Running it calls `rivet`.

== Helper files used by the above recipes

Blackhat:: A helper recipe file that can not be build on Singularity Hub due to
its 2 hours runtime limitation.  It must be built on another machine. Running
it exports a gzipped tar-file which can be downloaded and extracted from within
other recipes to install the BlackHat binaries. This is used in the
`Singularity.mceg` recipe.

Compare-1.9_patch:: A helper file used by the `Singularity.plotting` recipe to
fix the compilation of `Compare-1.9`.

rivet-bootstrap:: A helper file used by the `Singularity.rivet` recipe to allow
for custom download links for Rivet and its dependencies.
